*[Promote open access publishing]: Develop a strategy to publish your research and identify the appropriate publication channel(s) to implement that strategy. Use open publication strategies when possible. Be familiar with the use of information technology to support research, and with the development and management of CRIS (current research information systems) and institutional repositories. Provide licensing and copyright advice, use bibliometric indicators, and measure and report research impact.
*[Manage research data]: Produce and analyse research data originating from qualitative and quantitative research methods. Store and maintain the data in research databases.
