# How to contribute to the development of the MVS profiles

The MVS profiles are built using a GitHub open collaboration environment that can be used by any external party to provide comments using several different means.

If you would like to contribute with comments, suggestion or maybe concrete additions/changes to the MVS profiles please choose one of the contribution methods described below:

## GitHub Issues

Anyone can browse and view the content of the [MVS repository](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/MVS). This also enables interested external parties to reuse the MVS materials, but also analyse them in great detail. 

Anyone that goes to the MVS repository can use the Issues feature to provide comments or suggestions using the following steps:

1. Go to the [MVS repository on GitHub](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/MVS)
2. Choose Issues and then click on the "New issue" green button to create a new issue where a change can be suggested.

4. Click on "submit new issue"
5. The repository managers will be automatically notified that a new issue has been created
