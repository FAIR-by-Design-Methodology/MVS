# Minimum Viable Skills for **Civil Servant**


## Introduction: Open Science mission for this role

The Minimum Viable Skillset (MVS) sets out to describe a shared framework for recognizing the competencies required for civil servants engaged in advancing Open Science. Civil servants are typically employed by Ministers in government departments, where they perform a wide range of administrative, regulatory, or policy-related functions. Civil servants execute the Executive power of the State and play a critical role in ensuring that government operations run smoothly. Although the nature of civil service employment may vary by country and specific role, common positions include clerks, analysts, policy advisors, inspectors, and managers.

Civil servants act as central figures in the execution of government policies and administration. They are responsible for implementing and upholding government regulations, ensuring that public sector bodies operate according to established frameworks and guidelines. Civil servants also play a role in promoting transparency and accountability, particularly in the context of Open Science, by facilitating the appropriate access to and re-use of scientific data for public benefit. They ensure that administrative processes are neutral, non-partisan, and aligned with ethical standards.

One important aspect of civil service employment is that it is typically non-political. Civil servants are expected to remain neutral and non-partisan in their work, ensuring that public sector organizations operate fairly and effectively, free from political bias or favoritism. This neutrality allows them to carry out their duties impartially, maintaining the trust and confidence of the public.

Civil servants create and support open access to scientific knowledge, data, and research results, serving the public interest through the appropriate re-use of data produced and shared by research actions. By embedding Open Science principles into their work, civil servants ensure that the research data generated by various institutions is accessible and reusable, contributing to policy-making, innovation, and public benefit.

In their roles, civil servants uphold Open Science values such as transparency, ethical data use, and accessibility. They act as facilitators in connecting research outcomes with public policy, ensuring that scientific data informs government decisions and serves the public good. Their work supports evidence-based decision-making and aligns with the mission of promoting Open Science for societal benefit.
