## Introduction: Open Science mission for this role

The Minimum Viable Skillset (MVS) sets out to describe competencies required for Open Science practitioner roles. Data Stewards put Open Science principles into practice and are a key role for the European Open Science Cloud. The MVS includes two variations of the role, one described as ‘Coordinator’ and the other ‘Embedded’.

These represent two ends of a spectrum, with ‘Coordinator’ describing a role providing support across an organisation’s research domains and units, and ‘Embedded’ describing a role close to a research team and to its domain-specific practices. We acknowledge that these roles can overlap, influenced by the availability of resources, and by disciplinary and organisational cultures.   Data Stewardship expertise is typically distributed across a team, drawing on in-house capabilities and external services provided to the Research Performing Organisation, e.g.  by Research Infrastructures, Service Providers (e.g scholarly communications), and Competence Centres.

In general terms, Data Stewards work with stakeholders to establish, govern and maintain processes to collect research data, make it usable for research objectives, facilitate its transformation into research output, assist in quality assurance, and support informed decision-making on its openness for reuse according to ethical, legal and social expectations. 

In the EOSC specifically, in their roles as practitioners and champions of Open Science, trainers, and enablers of others in their organisation, Data Stewards are likely to be both consumers and providers of EOSC services or resources.

| Coordinator Data Stewards act as a ‘centralised knowledge and communication hub’ for researchers. They advise and train on policy, guidelines, data management plans, institutional infrastructure and tools to implement FAIR and CARE principles across the organisation. | Embedded Data Stewards serve research teams, faculties, departments, sections of organisations directly involved in producing research outputs, supporting them to plan and implement FAIR and CARE principles, meeting needs of researchers as they arise, and working with others to ensure outputs are preserved and reusable in the long term. |
| **Associated function titles**: Data Steward, Data Librarian, Research Data Management Specialist, Research Data Manager, Research Data Management Consultant, Reproducibility Librarian. | **Associated function titles**: Data Steward, Data Manager, Data Curator, Research Data Manager.                   |
