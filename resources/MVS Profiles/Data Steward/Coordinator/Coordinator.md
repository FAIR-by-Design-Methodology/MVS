## Essential Skills and Competences

### Technical 

- Cross-domain/ domain-specific knowledge on Open Science practices, policies and regulation and translating these (when necessary) to the appropriate levels of the organisation. 
- Service provision to support cross-domain/domain specific Open Science practices including: use of FAIR and CARE principles, Open Access, data optimization, data preservation, archiving and responsible re-use.
- Knowledge about Research Data Management, (personal) data governance and ethics, Open Science data publication and exchange(sharing) services, information security and risk management.
- Raising awareness of the value of good data management among data creators and users, researchers, organisational colleagues, and decision-makers.
- Advise/provide support on the use of infrastructure and tools at the appropriate levels of the organisation, e.g for data storage, data versioning and documentation, FAIR software and databases.
- Training design and delivery to support Open Science practices, policies and practices. 
- Monitor the research and funding ecosystem, including possible conflicting motivations, drivers and incentives among different stakeholders.
- Knowledge/awareness of programming, FAIR code and FAIR software and use of standards and ontologies.


### Soft/ transversal 

- Communication 
- Conflict management/mediation (with a patient, empathic approach)

## Background assumptions


### Main Activities 

- Contributes to Open Science policy development by engaging with (inter)national policy-making, bringing the cross-disciplinary expertise needed for local policy development, implementation and monitoring.
- Understands research stakeholder needs and contributes to developing, implementing and monitoring institutional RDM policy and Data Governance, along with tools and services to support these. Promotes and communicates the importance of Open Science and FAIR to all levels within the organization (e.g. policy makers, senior management, researchers, postgraduates etc.)
- Analyses trends in data management infrastructure, tools, and methods that potentially improve the organisation’s implementation of FAIR and CARE principles to enhance support  for decision-making on Open Science. Advises on (meta)data standards and contextual documentation for data archiving.
- Monitors RDM skills of researchers and research support staff in the institute and refers researchers to RDM related facilities and services.
- Develops and delivers training tailored to learners’ needs, aligned with wider institutional policies and plans
- Maintains networks of RDM and research support related colleagues.

### OS Outcomes

- Digital research objects are as FAIR and open as possible and as closed as necessary.
- Opportunities are identified for creating or connecting with professional Open Science networks at institutional, cross-institutional, regional, national, or international levels.
- Relevant competence centres with a FAIR data and Open Science support role are utilised effectively according to local needs and policies.
- Open Science skills and practices are facilitated and enhanced using, where appropriate, EOSC resources and services, including any relevant   Open Educational Resources .
- Research data and other digital objects are effectively managed to ensure their suitability for  archiving and sharing, and advancement of research methods appropriate to the discipline(s).
