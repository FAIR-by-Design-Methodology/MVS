# How to contribute to the development of the MVS profiles

The MVS profiles are built using a GitHub open collaboration environment that can be used by any external party to provide comments using several different means.

If you would like to contribute with comments, suggestion or maybe concrete additions/changes to the MVS profiles please choose one of the contribution methods described below:

## Contribution methods using GitHub tools

### GitHub Issues

Anyone can browse and view the content of the [MVS repository](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/MVS). This also enables interested external parties to reuse the MVS materials, but also analyse them in great detail. 

Anyone that goes to the MVS repository can use the Issues feature to provide comments or suggestions using the following steps:

1. Go to the [MVS repository on GitHub](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/MVS)
2. Choose Issues and then click on the "New issue" green button to create a new issue where a change can be suggested.

3. Provide a Title and add a description of the issue
  * you can even provide an attachment with marked changes for given profile or a brand new profile to be added
4. Click on "submit new issue"
5. The repository managers will be automatically notified that a new issue has been created

### GitHub Discussions

If you don't have any specific suggestions but would like to get in touch with the MVS team and discuss the MVS catalogue then you can use the Discussions feature:

1. Go to the [MVS repository on GitHub](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/MVS)
2. Choose Discussions and then click on the "New discussion" green button to start a new discussion
3. Choose the type of discussion that best serves your needs and click "get started"

4. Provide a Title and add a body for the message
4. Click on "start discussion"
5. The repository managers will be automatically notified that a new discussion message has been created

### Contributing through forking

The most "advanced" way of co-creation (for GitHub beginners) is to use forking to contribute to a public project. This action can be done by any external party that does not have direct write access to the repository (is not added as a contributor).

For these purposes, you need to use the "fork and pull workflow": 

1. Create a fork of the [MVS repository](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/MVS)
2. Clone the fork so that the content is available locally
3. Create a branch where all changes will be stored
4. Make and push changes to the branch
    * make changes directly in the MVS profiles
5. Make a pull request which will propose the made changes to the main MVS repository

The repository owner can review the pull request and decide to accept or reject it, or maybe ask for more information. Even if the owner decided not to accept the changes in the main repo, the fork will continue to exist separately and be visible to anyone browsing GitHub.


## Contributing via a direct contact with the MVS team

You can [reach out to the MVS team directly via email](mailto:a.whyte@ed.ac.uk) and start a discussion regarding the MVS profiles.

## Use the template to submit proposals for new profiles

You are encouraged to propose new MVS profiles based on the MVS template. For these purposes you can

* use the [template for a Minimum Viable Skillset](https://zenodo.org/records/10977747) to create a new profile 
* or [use the MD format for the template available in this repository](./MVS%20Template/template.md). 

Once you are finished with the definition of the profile send it to the MVS team for further analysis and official publication using direct email contact or by creating a new GitHub issue.
