These include data subjects, the researchers and organisations that produce data and other digital research objects, any vulnerable groups or communities affected, research funders, scientific journals, repositories, and other Research Data Infrastructures. </p> <p>Data Stewardship expertise is typically distributed across a team, drawing on in-house capabilities and any external services provided to the Research Performing Organisation, e.g. by a Competence Centre.
