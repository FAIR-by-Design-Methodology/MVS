We also acknowledge that a variety of other job titles may  perform the  data stewardship roles described here, e.g. Data Curator, Data Librarian, Data Manager, as well as Data Steward.  </p> <p>The two Data Steward MVS describe expertise needed to maximise the potential value of digital research objects for the scientific community and the public, while respecting the rights and legitimate interests of all other stakeholders concerned. These include data subjects, the researchers and organisations that produce data and other digital research objects, any vulnerable groups or communities affected, research funders, scientific journals, repositories, and other Research Data Infrastructures. </p> <p>Data Stewardship expertise is typically distributed across a team, drawing on in-house capabilities and any external services provided to the Research Performing Organisation, e.g. by a Competence Centre. The appropriate distribution of expertise will naturally depend on costs and needs, and will be influenced by disciplinary factors as well as the availability of skills to meet local needs.</p> <p>Data Stewards perform key roles in the EOSC.

However, there are opportunities for undergraduates to interact with data and software whilst working on assignments. Therefore, this MVS for undergraduate students is a general profile developed specifically in regard to data literacy knowledge, as it serves as basis for relevant OS activities and knowledge of the FAIR principles. For information related to basic skills for graduate students who are undertaking research activities, typically via dissertations and other assignments, see the MVS designed for Master\u2019s Students. For the basic skills and competencies needed for early career researchers, including postgraduate students (PhDs), please see the MVS for early career researchers.</p> <p>Organisational context:</p> <ul> <li>Research Performing Organisations (Universities)</li> </ul>","tags":["Minimum Viable Skillset","Undergraduate students"]},{"location":"MVS%20Profiles/Students/Undergratuates/undergraduates/#mission","title":"Mission","text":"<p>It is recognized that Open Science skills should be immersed within formal education at its earliest stages.
