Civil servants are typically employed by Ministers in government departments, where they perform a wide range of administrative, regulatory, or policy-related functions. Civil servants execute the Executive power of the State and play a critical role in ensuring that government operations run smoothly. Although the nature of civil service employment may vary by country and specific role, common positions include clerks, analysts, policy advisors, inspectors, and managers.</p> <p>Civil servants act as central figures in the execution of government policies and administration. They are responsible for implementing and upholding government regulations, ensuring that public sector bodies operate according to established frameworks and guidelines. Civil servants also play a role in promoting transparency and accountability, particularly in the context of Open Science, by facilitating the appropriate access to and re-use of scientific data for public benefit. They ensure that administrative processes are neutral, non-partisan, and aligned with ethical standards.</p> <p>One important aspect of civil service employment is that it is typically non-political. Civil servants are expected to remain neutral and non-partisan in their work, ensuring that public sector organizations operate fairly and effectively, free from political bias or favoritism. This neutrality allows them to carry out their duties impartially, maintaining the trust and confidence of the public.</p> <p>Civil servants create and support open access to scientific knowledge, data, and research results, serving the public interest through the appropriate re-use of data produced and shared by research actions. By embedding Open Science principles into their work, civil servants ensure that the research data generated by various institutions is accessible and reusable, contributing to policy-making, innovation, and public benefit.</p> <p>In their roles, civil servants uphold Open Science values such as transparency, ethical data use, and accessibility. They act as facilitators in connecting research outcomes with public policy, ensuring that scientific data informs government decisions and serves the public good. Their work supports evidence-based decision-making and aligns with the mission of promoting Open Science for societal benefit.</p>","tags":["Minimum Viable Skillset","Civil Servant"]},{"location":"MVS%20Profiles/Civil%20Servant/civil_servant/#civil-servant","title":"Civil Servant","text":"","tags":["Minimum Viable Skillset","Civil Servant"]},{"location":"MVS%20Profiles/Civil%20Servant/civil_servant/#associated-function-titles","title":"Associated function titles:","text":"<p>Civil Servant, Public Policy Advisor, Government Analyst, Administrative Officer, Policy Coordinator, Regulatory Specialist.</p>","tags":["Minimum Viable Skillset","Civil Servant"]},{"location":"MVS%20Profiles/Civil%20Servant/civil_servant/#essential-skills-and-competences","title":"Essential Skills and Competences","text":"<ul> <li>Good understanding of OS principles and practices, open data, open research, and open access</li> <li>Developing policies and guidelines that promote OS</li> <li>Solid understanding of OS research ethics</li> <li>Being familiar with technology and tools used to support OS practices</li> <li>Managing projects related to OS</li> <li>Providing training and education to researchers, policymakers, and public citizens about OS practices</li> <li>Evaluating the impact of OS practices and making recommendations for future improvement</li> <li>Good understanding of (personal and non-personal) data management, including data storing, analysis, and sharing according to the FAIR and OS principles</li> <li>Good understanding of the regulatory framework (national, regional, and international) concerning intellectual property rights (e.g., copyrights and trade secrets) and other non-personal data (e.g., research data and data held by Public Sector bodies).

They are responsible for facilitating the dissemination of scientific information, ensuring that research findings are accessible and actionable for various audiences. Knowledge brokers promote transparency and collaboration, particularly in the context of Open Science, by bridging the gap between research and practice, enabling informed decision-making. They strive to provide unbiased and reliable information, fostering trust among stakeholders while adhering to ethical standards in knowledge sharing.</p> <p>Associated function titles: Knowledge Broker, Honest Broker, Research Liaison, Information Specialist, Policy Advisor, Evidence Synthesis Expert, Science Communicator, Stakeholder Engagement Coordinator.</p> <p>The Minimum Viable Skillset (MVS) recognises the competencies essential for individuals or teams acting as intermediaries in the knowledge transfer process. The term \"knowledge broker\" refers to individuals or teams who, in a variety of contexts, facilitate the transfer of knowledge from experts to a wider audience. This practice encompasses diverse use cases with the common objective of disseminating scientific information and facilitating its use in society. Typical scenarios include appointed individual experts or expert groups informing public authorities or agencies about scientific findings, as well as aggregating research data to provide an overview of specific phenomena or fields. Such efforts support evidence-based decision-making and provide trustworthy and understandable information to laypeople.</p> <p>Knowledge brokers typically use their expertise to connect stakeholders with the information and resources they need to make informed decisions. They fill the gaps between science and various stakeholders, including policymakers, practitioners, and the public. Sometimes, groups, such as committees or learned societies, undertake this role.</p> <p>A notable subtype within this field is the \"honest broker.\" An honest broker serves as an impartial mediator, facilitating communication and decision-making among individuals or groups with differing interests or values. They maintain neutrality and bias-free positions, providing all parties with accurate information to help negotiate and find common ground. This role is especially critical in situations requiring fair and transparent processes, such as conflict resolution or public policy development.</p> <p>Knowledge brokers operate within various organizational contexts, including ministries, governmental organizations, research-performing organizations, national agencies, national funding organizations, communication/media agencies, and committees or learned societies.</p> <p>In relation to Open Science, the knowledge broker plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between research and practice by connecting researchers with stakeholders who can benefit from their work. They help create a more open, transparent, and collaborative research environment, leading to more effective and impactful research outcomes. This may involve collaborating closely with researchers to translate findings into actionable recommendations or providing policymakers with access to the latest accessible scientific evidence to inform decision-making. Additionally, knowledge brokers may promote Open Science practices within their organizations or communities, advocating for open access publishing, developing data-sharing policies, and supporting dissemination of research findings to a wider audience.## Related MVS Link to any other MVS that this MVS is based on (from those in Skills4EOSC D2.1)</p>","tags":["Minimum Viable Skillset","Knowledge

Undergraduates are potential future researchers and open science practitioners. By taking part in relevant open science training early, undergraduates become concerned citizens and better equipped to support open science.</p> <p>The Minimum Viable Skillset (MVS) for Undergraduates addresses the minimum competencies and skills needed by undergraduate students at the completion of their degree program in Open Science (OS). The MVS profile for undergraduates considers that undergraduate students do not typically undertake extensive research projects. However, there are opportunities for undergraduates to interact with data and software whilst working on assignments. Therefore, this MVS for undergraduate students is a general profile developed specifically in regard to data literacy knowledge, as it serves as basis for relevant OS activities and knowledge of the FAIR principles. For information related to basic skills for graduate students who are undertaking research activities, typically via dissertations and other assignments, see the MVS designed for Master's Students.
